# WeKernel

A kernel written in typescript.

## Why?

Why not?
Typescript is readable (even the most webshit among us can understand it) but nobody sane uses it to make an OS.
That's why it's perfect for OSDev - you have nice, high quality code samples while preventing people from just copy-pasting your code.

## How?

Using hacks and bad code.

## WHY Y U COMMITS NODE MODULES YOU BAD PERSON ?!?!

Because node_modules contains custom patches to make stuff work

## Building & running

```
sh build.sh
```
